#  Excel Data Cleaning Project  
  
Data cleaning is a crucial step in data analysis to ensure **accuracy, consistency, and reliability**. In this project, I performed data cleaning on an **Excel dataset** using various built-in functions and formatting techniques. The goal was to transform raw, inconsistent data into a **structured, well-organized format** for analysis.  

By applying **Excel-based data cleaning techniques**, I improved data quality by handling **blank values, duplicates, formatting inconsistencies, and whitespace issues**. The cleaned dataset is now ready for further processing and analysis.  

This project showcases **essential Excel data cleaning skills**, demonstrating how to efficiently prepare data before analysis or visualization.  

## Data Cleaning Techniques Used  
 **Autofit Rows and Columns** - Adjusted row height and column width for better readability.  
 **Identified and Filled Blank Cells** - Used **Go To Special → Blanks** and filled with appropriate values.  
 **Removed Duplicate Rows** - Used **Remove Duplicates** to clean redundant data.  
 **Converted Text to Number Format** - Used **Text to Columns** and **Error Checking**.  
 **Standardized Date Formats** - Ensured consistent format (e.g., `DD-MM-YYYY`).  
 **Formatted Number Values** - Applied correct formats to monetary, percentage, and decimal values.  
 **Trimmed Extra Spaces** - Used **TRIM function** to clean unnecessary spaces in text fields.  
 **Spell Checked Data** - Used **Excel’s Spell Check** to correct typos and errors.  
 **Formatted Text Using PROPER** - Applied **PROPER function** to standardize capitalization in text fields.  
 **Named the Table** - Assigned a meaningful name for better organization.  
 **Used Flash Fill** - Automatically arranged text fields (e.g., splitting full names into first and last names).  
   

##  Key Learnings  
- Effectively handling missing and inconsistent data.  
- Utilizing built-in Excel functions for automated data formatting.  
- Improving data structure for seamless analysis and visualization.
